# GreekHydraParty

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

This is a game for the Global Game Jam 2020.

The gamge works on the idea of a head of Hydra get chopped off and each time it spawns 2 more heads.
The trick is NOT to lose your head and have as little as possible heads.
The winner is the one who lost as little heads as possible.
